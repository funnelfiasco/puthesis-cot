  The remainder
  of this page was taken from page 13
  of the Grad School's thesis manual.

  Ph.D.~candidates are required to include a vita in their dissertation;
  however,
  this is optional for master's candidates.
  The vita is normally the last major division
  of the dissertation
  (unless followed by a publication)
  and should be separated from the preceding material
  by a cover sheet that is neither numbered nor counted.
  The content of this section will be largely driven
  by departmental requirements;
  in some cases,
  you may be asked to provide a curriculum vitae,
  detailing your professional and academic resume.
