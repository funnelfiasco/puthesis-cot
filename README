This is Purdue University's College of Technology LaTeX thesis and dissertation
    template. For reference, the College of Technology's web site regarding the
    LaTeX template and other templates can be found here:

This began as a "2012" update of the original `puthesis-cot` that Robert S.
    Cutler created in 2010 based on Mark Senn's `puthesis`. Mark Senn's
    `puthesis` is maintained at the following site:
    https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/

Because not all LaTeX distributions will come with the latest version of the
    apacite package, I have included the files required to use the latest
    version of the package, which is currently 2012-02-25 v6.01.
