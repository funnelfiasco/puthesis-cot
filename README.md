About
-----

This is Purdue University's College of Technology LaTeX thesis and dissertation template. For reference, the College of Technology's web site regarding the LaTeX template and other templates can be found here:
 http://www.tech.purdue.edu/Graduate/thesis_format.cfm

This began as a "2012" update of the original `puthesis-cot` that Robert S. Cutler created in 2010, based on Mark Senn's `puthesis`. Mark Senn's `puthesis` is maintained at the following site:
 https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/


Usage
-----

Download the tarball from GitHub (https://github.com/jrstjohn/puthesis-cot/downloads) and begin editing the files as needed.

If you want to follow the latest version of `puthesis-cot`, clone the GitHub repository.

**WARNING**: Do NOT edit your thesis in the same directory that you cloned the files. This warning does not apply if you downloaded and extracted the tarball.


Notes
-----

Because not all LaTeX distributions will come with the latest version of the apacite package, I have included the files required to use the latest version of the package, which at the time of this writing is 2012-02-25 v6.01.

I only use (therefore, only familiar with) TeX Live 2012. I may not be able to offer much useful advice if you use a different LaTeX distribution.
