Comments in BibTeX files can occur anywhere with no special characters.

BibTeX entries begin with an at sign.  I can't put an at sign here
because BibTeX would think an entry is beginning.  Everything outside
of entries that begin with is ignored.

This is the BibTeX data file for a simple, example thesis.

I like to put the entries in order by key.  The key consists of the
primary author's last name followed by a colon and the year of
publication.  If, for example, I later added a second publication for
an author in the same year the key might be 'Smith:2006b'.
