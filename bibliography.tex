%  This is the bibliography for the thesis.
%

% IF YOU USE BIBTEX USE THE FOLLOWING LINE:
\bibliography{all}

% If BibTeX produces a .bbl file that is close to what you want but
% not exactly right you may want to include the contents of the .bbl
% file below and use the instructions immediately below.  If you do
% this you'll want to do it after you've cited all your references
% and are running LaTeX on the final copy of your thesis.  I recommend
% running LaTeX three times after changing this file like you'd like
% it.

% OTHERWISE (YOU ARE NOT USING BIBTEX), USE THE FOLLOWING LINES:
% Format the bibliography items like your school or department wants.
